## 🚀 Project Overview
As automation accelerates, understanding job security becomes crucial. This project leverages **Random Forest Classification** and **Data Normalization** techniques to predict whether a specific job role falls into a Low, Medium, or High automation risk category based on current market trends.

### Key Features:
* **High-Precision Classification:** Achieved an **Accuracy of 91%** through optimized feature engineering.
* **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifies key drivers such as AI Replacement Score and Skill Gap Index.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Integrated with a Streamlit front-end for real-time predictions.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Analyzes workforce dynamics across 15,000+ records (2020-2026 simulation).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.12
* **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn (Random Forest), Pandas, NumPy
* **Preprocessing:** StandardScaler, Label Encoding
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit
* **Deployment:** GitHub & Streamlit Cloud

## 🧠 The Pipeline
1. **EDA:** Detailed analysis of industry-wise risk distribution.
2. **Preprocessing:** Handling categorical data and feature scaling for numerical stability.
3. **Model Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning to boost accuracy from 44% to 91%.
4. **Serialization:** Models and scalers exported as `.pkl` files for production use.
